[{"content":"A few days ago, Apple announced that it would begin checking content uploaded to iCloud Photos - the company’s photo backup/synchronization service - against a list of known CSAM material. This is fine on it’s own, however the system could easily be abused.\nSo what happens when a government says “We want you to add these hashes of government-critical memes to your database”? Apple says they would “refuse such demands”, I doubt they could.\nOne of the first issues I noticed is with their marketing. Apple is arguing that, because the detection happens on your device, as opposed to on their servers, it’s more privacy-friendly. But Apple can already view uploaded data, iCloud does not use end-to-end encryption - in fact, they even dropped plans to do so after the FBI complained.\nThis is all further evidence that Apple only cares about privacy when they can market it. Explaining to the average consumer that you use “end-to-end encryption” doesn’t increase sales; most people don’t even know what that means. And if it doesn’t increase sales, why even bother in the first place?\n The only way to guarantee that such a powerful tool isn’t abused and doesn’t fall into the wrong hands is to never create it.\n - Apple, 2016\n","permalink":"https://nchristopher.me/posts/apple-privacy/","summary":"A few days ago, Apple announced that it would begin checking content uploaded to iCloud Photos - the company’s photo backup/synchronization service - against a list of known CSAM material.

There\u0026rsquo;s essentially no way for a closed-source system\u0026rsquo;s code to be verified.\nWhich is why people concerned about their privacy \u0026amp; security should use Libre operating systems, such as Linux. But that\u0026rsquo;s not where it ends.\nThe Intel Management Engine Intel\u0026rsquo;s Management Engine (ME for short, which is what I\u0026rsquo;ll be calling it) is a seperate computing enviornment present on every Intel chip since mid 2006. The ME has it\u0026rsquo;s own storage, memory, cache, along with direct access to the computer\u0026rsquo;s RAM and network access. The ME is signed by Intel, and the computer wont boot unless the signature is valid.\nThe ME contains a web server allowing remote users to manage the computer - even while the PC is turned off (as long as the motherboard has power). While traffic is encrypted using SSL/TLS, pretty much every version of SSL/TLS has had major vulnerabilities.\nAnd this issue isn\u0026rsquo;t even intel-specific - AMD has a similar product called \u0026ldquo;Platform Security Processor\u0026rdquo;, though it\u0026rsquo;s implementation is quite different.\nTLDR The Intel Management Engine can be (and likely is) used as a backdoor, with complete access to the system over the internet.
